# Welcome to Pokégle!


Have you ever wanted to quickly look up a pokémon's stats? Maybe to see if your 'mon would take its turn first, or to see if the opponent has a troublesome ability? Well, rejoice! Pokégle is here for you!

Right now, all you have to do is type in the pokémon's name and you'll get all of the necessary battle information!

And, rest assured that this site will be updated when stats are changed and new pokémon are added!

Please let me know if there are any features you would like to see added, or if you encounter any issues or incorrect information.

Enjoy using Pokégle!

# What I Learned From Making This Website:

React : Pokegle is built in React. I learned about and utitlized many different hooks including: useState, useReducer, useContext, and useEffect.

React Router : The website is a single-page application but appears to have multiple pages. I utilized nested and dynamic routes as well to make navigating the website better. Users can link certain parts of the website to their friends thanks to the routes.

LocalStorage : Pokegle allows users to "pin" Pokemon and the browser will remember and load those pins when they return to the website. 

# Current Known Issues:

# To-do

Add a dark mode. 

Add a type chart.
